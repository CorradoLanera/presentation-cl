### Structured data (AKA _phenomaping_)

  + statistical analyses for clinical research

  + clustering patterns for genetic counting data


--


### Unstructured data

  + Patient kinetic data from wearable devices
    
  + Free-Text mining from electronic medical records

# \#1 PediaNET<sup>*</sup>

_A pediatric general practice research database_

#### more then 300 family pediatricians distributed throughout Italy
#### near 100,000 children followed by

- reason for accessing health care
- health status
- personal details
- growth parameters
- diagnoses
- clinical details (**free-text** or ICD-9 code)
- prescriptions,
- specialistic appointment
- diagnoses procedures
- hospital admissions
- outcome data

**Learners**<sup>**</sup>

 - LogitBoost (F: 68.5 [59.3–77.7])
 - GLMNet (F: 36.5 [32.2–40.8]) 
 - Multinomial Logistic (F: 19.1 [17.2–20.9])

# Lessons learned
  - Always test on unseen data
  - Impact of the preprocessing
  - Value of boostrap
  - Sigle occurrence in a life-time (time-independent)

# \#2 _Digression on Systematic Reviews_<sup>*</sup>

# \#2 _Digression on Systematic Reviews_

#### The problem of class imbalance

**Assumption**:
The validity of Systematic Reviews depends on the ability to fully capture the complete body of evidence through searches of many and heterogeneous data sources.

--

<small>_Baudard et al. (2017) “**Impact of Searching Clinical Trial Registries in Systematic Reviews of Pharmaceutical Treatments: Methodological Systematic Review and Reanalysis of Meta-Analyses.**” Bmj 356_</small>

- Increase in the number of patients: **from 10% to 50%**
- Change in summary statistics: **from 0% to 29%**

--

**Our aim**: replacing complex interfaces for researchers with Text Mining of available textual fields in clinical registries

--

**Main issue**: MLTs are generally biased towards the majority class samples

**Strategies**<sup>**</sup>

- Random Under Sampling
- Random Over Sampling


- 35:65 minority:majority ratio
- 50:50 minority:majority ratio

</small>

**Results**<sup>\*\*\*</sup>
  - improve: RUS-35:65, ROS-50:50
  - worsen: kNN (all strategies)
  - almost neutral: SVM
    - (RUS-50:50 worsened it)

class: middle, inverse

# Lesson learned
  - Is not a good idea using class imbalance strategies w/ kNN
  - RUS 35:65 can be effective to reduce time and gain AUC
  - SVM could be the first choice for a fast and performing MLT

.pull-rigth[
**Data**
  - 1789 ED visits with reported discharge diagnoses (Free-Text) from 9 Nicaraguan hospitals
  - diagnoses were manually revised and classified by an independent
peer-review group of expert pediatricians

**Learning strategy**
- bootstrap samples: distribution of results
- repeated CV: overfitting controll
- OOB performance: full use of data
- RF: 500 trees each (enought to converge)

**Results**
- overall accuracy: 0.7831 [0.7792-0.7965]

- opinion on the project steps and strategy
- NLP suggestion about preproc imporvement
- management of time-dependent input
- management of time-dependent output:
  - within the model (recurrent)
  - between the classifications (count of events/time) 

- try to give you back my two cents
