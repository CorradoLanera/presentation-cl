### MLT in clinical environments

* structured data (AKA _phenomaping_)

--
* unstructured data

    + Patient kinetic data from wearable devices
    
    + Free-Text mining from electronic medical records

# Outline

- Journey to the problem, through the issues encountered

- Choices to be taken

- Flowchart proposal

- Personal expectation from the HLP Lab experience
---

# PediaNET






---

# \#1 Varicella Zoster virus (_chickenpox_) detection 

--

- Impact of the preprocessing







---

# \#2 COmprehensive Searches ThroUgh Machine learning for systEmatic Reviews

--

- class imbalance








---

# \#3 Automatic classification of free-text diagnoses

--

- multi-source
- multi-label
- strong validation








---

# \#4 Otitis

- Why it does matter?

--

- multi-label
- multi-stage
- time-dependant
- multi-source
- unbalanced

# PediNET dataset and structure

- records:
- patients:
- variables:
- (language: italian)

class: center, inverse, middle

# Options


---

# Preprocessing

- remove: extra white spaces, non-words, stop-words
- merge: lowering, stemming/lammatization
- augment: n-gram

--

- enrich (NLP): tag, pos, sentiment, ...

-- 

- machine-translate: TF-iDF?







--- 

# Data imbalance

type: RUS/ROS
prop: 35:65, 50:50



---

# Machine Learning Method

- classical: GLMNet, logistic, ...
- full-data: SVM, CART, ...
- boosted: RF, GBM, logitboost, ...
- deep: CNN, RNN, ...
- ensembled: SuperLearner





---

# ML design

- stages: one, more
- parameter selection: (repeated) CV, boosting
- learning curves: useful to select or switch to more complex model
- validation: data from which distribution?
- metric: sensitivity, NNP, AUC, ...



--- 
# Production

- fixed model
- active learning

# Expectation from the HLP Lab experience



---
- opinion on the project steps and strategy
- NLP suggestion about prproc imporvement
- management of time-dependant input
- management of time-dependant output:
  - within the model (recurrent)
  - between the classifications (count of events/time) 

- try to give you back my two cents
