# My research at UBEPH

# MLT in clinical environments


### Structured data (AKA _phenomaping_)

  + Statistical analyses for clinical research

  + Clustering patterns for genetic counting data



### Unstructured data

  + Patient kinetic data from wearable devices
    
  + Free-Text mining from electronic medical records

# PediaNET

A pediatric general practice research database

#### Network of more then 450 family pediatricians distributed throughout Italy (120-130 providing data)
#### Near 100,000 children followed by

# #1 insights 
  - Sigle occurrence in a life-time (time-independent)
  - Always test on unseen data in the training set
  - Impact of the preprocessing (most impact from lowering and 2-gram)
  - Value of boostrap-based learner

---

# \#2 Extend Systematic Review to registries

**Assumption**:
The validity of Systematic Reviews depends on the ability to fully capture the complete body of evidence through searches of many and heterogeneous data sources.

<small>_Baudard et al. (2017) “**Impact of Searching Clinical Trial Registries in Systematic Reviews of Pharmaceutical Treatments: Methodological Systematic Review and Reanalysis of Meta-Analyses.**” Bmj 356_</small>

- Increase in the number of patients: **from 10% to 50%**
- Change in summary statistics: **from 0% to 29%**

**Our aim**: replacing complex interfaces for researchers with Text Mining of available textual fields in clinical registries


**Main issue**:
> MLTs are generally biased towards the majority class samples

# Insights #2
  - SVM could be the first choice for a fast and performing MLT
  - RUS 35:65 can be effective to reduce time (and space) gaining AUC
  - Class imbalance strategies drastically worsen $k$-NN models

**Data**
  - 1789 ED visits with reported discharge diagnoses (Free-Text) from 9 Nicaraguan hospitals
  - Diagnoses were manually revised and classified by an independent
peer-review group of expert pediatricians

**Learning strategy**
- Bootstrap samples: distribution of results
- Repeated CV: overfitting controll
- OOB performance: full use of data
- RF: 500 trees each forest (to convergence)

**Results**
- overall accuracy: 0.7831 [0.7792-0.7965]

# Insights #3
  - Lemmata (instead of stemming) improve results and interpretation
  - Value of a bootstrap superstructure
    - strong internal validation
    - data-driven, non-parametric confidence intervals
    - complete use of all the labelled data at the disposal

class: middle

- opinion on the project steps and strategy
- NLP suggestion about preproc imporvement
- management of time-dependent input
- management of time-dependent output:
  - within the model (recurrent)
  - between the classifications (count of events/time) 

- try to give you back my two cents
