Title: LIMPIDO: a LearnIng Machine for PedIatric Detection of Otitis

Abstract:
Acute otitis media (AOM) is a widespread infectious disease in children, and one of the leading causes of antibiotics prescription.

The PediaNET database is a pediatric general practice research
database containing reasons for accessing healthcare, health status,
diagnoses, clinical details, prescriptions and outcome data from more
than 300 family pediatricians throughout Italy.

During 2018, the Italian PediNET database was investigated by the
PediaNET team to analyze Acute Otitis Media (AOM) treatments. For the
analyses, ICD-9 codes and free-text only from the "primary diagnosis"
field were used. The primary limitation of the study was the
impossibility of manually validate the cases, possibly including False Positive or detecting cases reported only in the "diary" field.

The objective of the project is to develop a multi-stage machine learning based system to classify PediNET records as not-otitis\otitis,
media\not-media otitis, acute\not-acute otitis media (AOM), and for the
AOM if they are recurrent or with perforation.

The talk is focused on the presentation of the previous research
conducted in the field of text mining electronic health records.
Also, a tentative flow-chart for the development of the interested model
will be presented.

The aim is to start a concrete discussion on the possible way of
collaboration during the visiting period to the HLP Lab at the
University of Pennsylvania.
